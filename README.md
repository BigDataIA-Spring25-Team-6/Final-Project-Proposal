## Project Overview
### Objective

This project aims to build a smart, AI-powered Interview Preparation Assistant that helps candidates get interview-ready based on both their resume and the job descriptions they care about.

The system brings together a few powerful pieces:

A simple Streamlit interface where users can upload their resume and choose a target job, along with the Mock Interview, Networking tool and FAQ chatbot.
A FastAPI backend that coordinates all the processing
A resume parser powered by Mistral to extract meaningful content
A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built with CrewAI and MCP tools
And finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge agent to synthesize everything into focused, useful guidance

Whether it’s surfacing the right LeetCode questions, offering role-specific insights, or preparing for behavioral rounds, this assistant helps users prep smarter—not harder.
